### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Andy, and I'm a developer (mainly javascript/React) at [AND Digital](https://and.digital).

I've got a [website](https://andydavison.dev) (not regularly touched) and a [twitter](https://twitter.com/andydavison) (not especially dev-focused), but if you're reading this, chances are you already know me! If not, why not say [hi](mailto:andy@andydavison.dev?subject=Hi%20Andy%21)?
